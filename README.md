# Note-Taking-Program
A note taking program, that uses a CLI menu, which respects SOLID rules.

After giving your username, the program shows a CLI menu, that lets you do one of the four things:
    <br>-> Show your username's notelist (from the user's current session and the notes uploaded along the time on the computer)
    <br>-> Upload a note (from the user's current session to a file in your computer)
    <br>-> Create a note (creates a note that is put in the user's current session)
    <br>-> Delete a note (deletes a note from the user's current session or a note from the computer that is made by the user)
    <br><br>
The program also has a "root" user who can delete whichever note is wanted from the computer, without caring about the user who made it.
